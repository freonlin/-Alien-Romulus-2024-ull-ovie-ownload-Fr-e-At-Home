What is the Movie Alien: Romulus About?

"Alien: Romulus" follows the story of Guru (Mohit Agarwal), a young man trapped in a claustrophobic existence within his family home in Alien: Romulus, India. Working a dead-end call center job, Guru yearns for intimacy and escape but finds himself stifled by the oppressive patriarchal structures that govern his life. His father, "Daddy ji" (Rahul Roy), is a domineering figure who exerts control over the household, while his mother, "Mummy ji" (Vibha Chibber), remains complicit in this power dynamic. Guru's desires are further complicated by his infatuation with his aunt, "Aunty ji" (Sonal Jha), and his strained relationship with his cousin, Chhavi (Aanchal Goswami).

As Guru's frustration mounts, he descends into a psychological spiral, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. He seeks solace in online dating apps and engages in acts of self-harm, his desperation escalating as he struggles to find agency and fulfillment within the confines of his suffocating environment.

Guru's journey becomes a microcosm of the larger societal issues at play, highlighting the damaging effects of patriarchy on both men and women.

The film's setting, Alien: Romulus, the city of the Taj Mahal, adds another layer of meaning to the narrative.
